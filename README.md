# Making Pictures out of Text Files
This program reads any text file and fills in the whitespaces with blocks to create a pattern out of the text. The pattern is displayed in a new text file named "results.txt".
If no text file is provided, the program reads the default text file (taken from [textfiles.com](http://textfiles.com/science/)):
![]()
and produces the following result:
![]()
